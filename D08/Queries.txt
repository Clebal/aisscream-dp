1 - The average and the standard deviation of rendezvouses created per user.

select avg(cast((select count(r) from Rendezvous r where r.creator=u) as float )), sqrt(sum((select count(r) from Rendezvous r where r.creator=u)*(select count(r) from Rendezvous r where r.creator=u))/(select count(u2) from User u2)-avg(cast((select count(r) from Rendezvous r where r.creator=u) as float ))*avg(cast((select count(r) from Rendezvous r where r.creator=u) as float ))) from User u

2 - The ratio of users who have ever created a rendezvous versus the users who have never created any rendezvouses.



3 - The average and the standard deviation of users per rendezvous.



4 - The average and the standard deviation of rendezvouses that are RSVPd per user.

select avg(cast((select count(r.rendezvous) from Rsvp r where r.attendant.id=u.id) as float )),sqrt(sum((select count(r.rendezvous) from Rsvp r where r.attendant.id=u.id)*(select count(r.rendezvous) from Rsvp r where r.attendant.id=u.id))/(select count(u2) from User u2)-avg(cast((select count(r.rendezvous) from Rsvp r where r.attendant.id=u.id) as float ))*avg(cast((select count(r.rendezvous) from Rsvp r where r.attendant.id=u.id) as float ))) from User u;



5 - The top-10 rendezvouses in terms of users who have RSVPd them.

select r from Rendezvous r, User u, RSVP s where r.creator=u and s.attendant=u ORDER BY r.termCondition DESC;

6 - The average and the standard deviation of announcements per rendezvous.



7 - The rendezvouses that whose number of announcements is above 75% the average number of announcements per rendezvous.



8 - The rendezvouses that are linked to a number of rendezvouses that is great-er than the average plus 10%.
select r from Rendezvous r where cast((select count(r2) from Rendezvous r2 join r2.linkerRendezvouses l where l.id=r.id)as float)>(select avg(cast((select count(r2) from Rendezvous r2 join r2.linkerRendezvouses l where l.id=r3.id)as float))*1.1 from Rendezvous r3); 


9 - The average and the standard deviation of the number of questions per ren-dezvous.

select avg(cast((select count(q) from Question q where q.rendezvous=r) as float )), sqrt(sum((select count(q) from Question q where q.rendezvous=r)*(select count(q) from Question q where q.rendezvous=r))/(select count(r2) from Rendezvous r2)-avg(cast((select count(q) from Question q where q.rendezvous=r) as float ))*avg(cast((select count(q) from Question q where q.rendezvous=r) as float ))) from Rendezvous r

10 - The average and the standard deviation of the number of answers to the questions per rendezvous.



11 - The average and the standard deviation of replies per comment.
